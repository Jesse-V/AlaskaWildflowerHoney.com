                            <p>We provide extracting services for those who do not have time to process the honey themselves.  Our twin radials allow us to extract frames with less danger of blowout than tangential extractors.  We charge $.50 per pound with a 50 pound minimum charge.  We extract for others after our harvest is done to keep your honey separate from ours allowing you to be assured that the honey that you receive back comes from your own hives.</p>

                            <p>Please call before you come out so that we may be ready for your arrival.  Your supers need to be free of bees and brood and drop off times must be during non flight hours if at all possible.  We have our hives located very near our extracting room and robbing of supers in the back of someone's truck turns into a frenzy within 5 minutes of arrival during mid-day.  Please make sure that your truck is free of spilled honey from your supers so that when we have unloaded your supers there is nothing left to attract bees.
                            </p>
                            <p>We use a commercial grade mechanical uncapperâ€”A Cowen Silver Queen that uses a pair of hot vibrating knives to uncap with.  Although uncommon, warped or damaged frames may not feed well through our machine and may need to be uncapped by hand.

                            <p>We can hive your packages of bees here in our own starter yard.  We started offering this service several years ago to beekeepers who were out of town or away on business during the package arrival time.
                            </p>
                            <p>You may bring your hive to our yard prior to the bees arriving as a single deep box.  We will install your package, release the queen and have the hive ready for pickup 2 weeks after hiving.  As many beekeepers understand, hives should not be transported  or radically disturbed for a couple of weeks after the new queen is released.  It is possible to transport hives prior to this but queens are not guaranteed under this situation.
                            </p>
                            <p>Your equipment should be in good serviceable shape and be able to be made bee tight for your return trip.

                        <h2>Honey Processing</h2>
                        <p>We also offer services for processing your honey as well.  When we extract your honey, cappings are kept separate from the comb.  These are placed in a small  container for you as well.  Your honey is caught straight out of the extractor into a new food grade 5 gallon bucket.  If you wish, you can provide your own buckets and we will extract into them instead.  This may save you some money as the new food grade buckets cost about $10.00 each.  Our extractors sit high enough to accept a 6 gallon bucket under the spout.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you wish, we can run the honey through more processing and skim the wax off the top for you.  We will do this after allowing the honey to settle for several days to allow all of the small wax particles to rise to the surface.
                        </p>
                        <p>We also have the ability to heat the honey to retard the tendency for the honey to crystallize and give it a longer liquid shelf life. Our heater system is set up for buckets of honey to be placed into a water bath heated to your chosen temperature.  Our heater controls are sensitive enough to maintain the set temperature within a couple of degrees.
                        </p>
                        <p>We also can filter your honey through a fine nylon cloth to remove most all of the visible particles.  Your honey will need to be above 100 degrees to do this.  Although we can filter honey at temperatures less than this it is more time consuming and an extra charge will have to be added.
                        </p>
                        <p>Let us know if you want your honey in a bucket with a bottling spout on it.  This is the most convenient method of receiving your honey ready for placing into your own containers.</p>
