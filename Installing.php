    <p>Driving directions to our place would be as follows:

At mile 5.5 Big Lake road you will come to South Port Marina.  Echo Lake Drive takes off to the left just after the entrance to the marina.  Go 1.25 miles down Echo Lake Drive; the road will fork.  Take the left fork.  This road will take you to our place, another 1.25 miles  down the road.  You should be aware that there is a locked gate that keeps our community private and quiet.  Be sure to call us before you come out so that we can make sure that the gate is open.  A beehive marks the head of our driveway which is near our neighbors horse corral.
