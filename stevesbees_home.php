        <b>Packages of honeybees now available</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Hello beekeepers! We have reopened our honeybee store, available through the button on the right. You can now order Carniolan or Italian honeybees for next year. Bee delivery is in April and packages go quickly, so please place your order as soon as possible to avoid being left out.

        <b>Hello ALL Beekeepers,</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Your bees are coming in this weekend.  If everything goes as scheduled, we expect to have the bees available to us at 8 or 9:00 in the morning on Saturday.  We will send some bees down to the Peninsula.  We expect to have them sorted and on their way by ten.  We also expect the Anchorage packages to be over at the Barnett's house by 10:30 and ready for pick up by 11:30.  We expect to be in the Eagle River area around 11:30-12:00.  We will be meeting in the VFW Hall in Eagle River as we only have a handful of beekeepers picking up.  The above schedule should put us at Tom Ryan's house by about 1:00 for all Palmer and Wasilla beekeepers.   The bees will be ready for pick up at Tom's by 2:00.  We estimate that we will be back at Big Lake by about 4PM.  Steve and Donna
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>FAIRBANKS BEEKEEPERS!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Because the delivery schedule can change due to unforeseen circumstances, it will be better that we take the bees to Fairbanks Sunday morning, the 27th, with expected arrival time between one or two in the afternoon.  We will feed the bees Saturday night so that they will be well hydrated and have sufficient food for the remainder of the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>PENINSULA BEEKEEPERS:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Jim VanRaden will be moving the bees down the Peninsula to the Sterling / Soldotna area.   Rick Lantz will be transporting and distributing the bees from that point

    <h3>April 9, 2014 update</h3>

    <p>
    Good Evening Beekeepers,
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Bees are arriving for you on the 12th.  That is this Saturday.</b>  Our expected arrival time for the bees at the Anchorage airport will be between 8 and 9 in the morning.  We expect to have the bees for Anchorage delivered to the Barnett's house by 10.  Keep in mind that this is a new routing for the air transport that we will be using and the timing that I have predicted may be different than what actually happens.  Here are directions to the Barnett's house:<br><i>
    Take AK-1 S to Boniface Rd in Anchorage. Take the Mountain View Dr exit<br>
    Take Boniface Pkwy and Elmore Rd to E 72nd Ave<br>
    Turn left onto Boniface Rd<br>
    Continue onto Boniface Pkwy<br>
    Continue onto Dr Martin Luther King Jr Ave<br>
    Turn left onto Elmore Rd<br>
    Turn right onto E 72nd Ave<br>
    Destination will be on the left<br>
    </i>
    <p>
    3780 E 72nd Ave<br>
    Anchorage, AK 99507
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
    As always, we will update the home answering machine with an updated message for the delivery schedule.  If the bees are delayed or on schedule, the home machine will have the latest information.  907-892-6175  We will update the machine each time that the situation changes.
    </p>
    <p>
    When the bees arrive at your pickup location, we will call the numbers that you provided when you ordered to let you know that the bees are ready for pickup.  We have a large shipment arriving, and as soon as we can clear out the packages from the Barnett's garage, the easier it will be for them to get on with the business of attending to their own bees.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Bees for the Eagle River area should be at Preston Johnson's house and ready for pickup by 11 in the morning.</b>  Directions to Preston Johnson's house are as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
    Drive up the Eagle River Valley to P&M greenhouse.  Beside the greenhouse is a road that goes down over the hill.  Preston's house is the big white one near the bottom of the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
    We will call you when the bees are ready to pick up.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>We do have a few bees for the Palmer area.</b>  Our meeting point will be at the park and ride lot on the corner of Trunk Road and the Parks Highway.  We will update the home machine when we leave Anchorage so that you will have time to get to the meeting spot.  Because we will have a full trailer load heading to Fairbanks, we will not be stopping and waiting for you to arrive at the meeting place.  The cooling of the bees in the trailer depends upon air flow through the trailer while we are moving.  This limits our time at the places where we will be meeting you.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Bees for the Wasilla area will be at AIH parking lot in Wasilla.</b>  Once again, we will be stopping only long enough to unload the bees for the beekeepers that are there ready for pickup.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Bees for Fairbanks will be distributed from the Monroe High School parking lot on the side that borders Betty Street.</b>  We will update the home answering machine from several points along the Parks Highway as we progress northward.  This will allow the beekeepers from Delta Junction to have the time to travel to Fairbanks and arrive close to the same time that we do with the bees.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>As of yet we do not have a beekeeper who has let us know that they are willing to carry bees for others from Fairbanks to the Delta area.</b>  When one lets us know, we will send that information out.
    </p>
    <p>
    Steve and Donna

    <div class="right_image">
        <img src="images/closeup_packages.jpg" alt="Crated four-pound package of honeybees."/>
        <p>These packages weigh 4 pounds and contain about 15,000 bees. The condition of the packages shown here is typical of our shipments over the past several years.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Bee orders are filling up.</p>

    <p><b>We have approximately 150 packages left.</b> At this point we are filling the last shipment day on the 26th of April.</p>

    <p>California has received a bit of rain and is due to get more this weekend.  That should greatly improve the situation for the bees.</p>

    <p>Our shipping dates have changed somewhat from last year's method.  A portion of our normal route involved ground transportation by truck.  That portion of our shipment has changed as the trucking company informed us that they will no longer be transporting any live cargo.  Even though our routing and booked space was confirmed before the policy change, our shipments still fall into the live cargo category.  This has caused us to change ground transportation routes and reorganize our delivery schedule as well as the number of packages on each load of bees to arrive.  We have reduced our shipments to three separate shipments.  All shipments will arrive on a Saturday.  This means that we will have a number of the bees for the Anchorage and Eagle River area arrive on the first shipment the 12th of April along with the bees for the Interior.  Most of the bees for Palmer and Wasilla will arrive on the following Saturday along with bees for Soldotna and Big Lake on the 19th.  Those who want their bees later in the month and also those who order bees after allotted space fills up on the two earlier shipments will have their bees arrive on the last Saturday, April 26th.</p>

    <p>I will be accompanying the bees on the land portion of their journey from the bee yard to the airfreight terminal for at least the first shipment and quite possibly the following shipments.  We still intend to drop off supplies with the bees for those who have ordered supplies from us to be delivered.  However, because of the change of shipping and our focus on the safe arrival of the bees, we will be closing our supply storehouse starting on the first of April.  We will remain closed until the bees have all been safely delivered to their drop points.</p>

    <p>
        Planned delivery dates are as follows:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairbanks and Interior Alaska: April 12th.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anchorage and Eagle River: April 12th.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldotna and Palmer: April 19th.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wasilla and Big Lake: April 19th.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late orders (all locations): April 26th.

    <h3>Update as of March 15, 2014</h3>

    <p><b>Package bees are sold out for 2014!</b> If you still need bees, I would suggest calling Jack Anderson soon as it is my understanding that he still has some packages left.</p>

    <p>I set aside a number of packages in my shipment to cover some packages that do not make the trip in good health.  Typically we have very good success in shipping bees to Alaska, and almost all packages arrive in good shape.  This year we are holding back 35 packages of the total shipment in case we have any problems.  I will not know if these packages will be available until the last shipment on the 26th has arrived and the health of all the packages has been checked.  This should be done by about 9 am Saturday morning on the 26th of April.  At that time, we will be able to phone beekeepers on the standby list to receive any of those 35 packages.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in the short notice of package availability, please let us know and we can reserve one of the short notice packages for you.</p>
