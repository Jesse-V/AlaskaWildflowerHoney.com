We take image attribution very seriously and never seek to use copyrighted material intentionally or by accident. Thus we have provided proper attribution for all images used on this site. Unless specified otherwise, all images are ours, taken our own cameras. However, there are some images which our not ours, and we have therefore provided sources both on the site and reiterated in detail below:

1) In the navigation section in the upper left of every page, the flying honeybee next to each navigation item was modified by me. It was flipped, cropped, and the background was made transparent. The original was uploaded to https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Apis_mellifera_Female.jpg by user Lymantria. It was taken by "The Packer Lab: Bee Tribes of the World" and is also available at http://www.yorku.ca/bugsrus/bee_genera_of_the_world/Bee_Tribes.html.

2) Below the navigation, the hovering honeybee visiting the purple flower was cropped by me. It was originally uploaded to https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NKN-2007-07-02_101750b_Honey_Bee_(_in_Canada_)_(Yvan_Leduc_author_for_Wikipedia).jpg by Yvan Leduc, and since the images was cropped by me, I make it also available under the same Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.

3) In the Supplies Store page, the picture of beehives on a wooden pallet was originally uploaded to https://www.flickr.com/photos/32917625@N02/3614389353 by Jessica Reeder. It then appeared on https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bee_boxes_at_an_organic_farm.jpg under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license. I have not modified the image from the original, aside from using a lower resolution version, which Wikimedia offered.

4) In the Bee Store page, the images of the pollen-laden honeybee visiting the purple flower was taken by Jerzy Strzelecki and was uploaded to https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Apis_mellifera(js)08.jpg under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license. Attribute details were not provided by the author, so I referenced his name and the site to which he uploaded it.

5) Also in the Bee Store page, the images of the queen bee surrounded by attendants is a rotated and cropped version of the original, which was uploaded to https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Apis_mellifera_scutellata_1355021.jpg. It was taken by in 2005 by Scott Bauer or the USDA Agricultural Research Service, and as such it is in the public domain.
