                        <p>Alaska Wildflower Honey is a small beekeeping operation that is run by the Victors family on Fish Creek in Big Lake, Alaska.  We have between 60 and 100 hives and keep many of our bees near where we live.  We run several yards of bees with each yard having up to 25 hives in it.  This keeps the bees spread out over the general area and assures that there will be enough forage for all the colonies.
                        </p>
                        <p>When we began beekeeping our yards were all located in the area that was extensively burned with a major wildfire in 1996.  This fire changed the growth from mature birch and spruce forest to many open areas of fireweed and wildflowers.  Bees will forage in a range that is within a mile and a half of their hive.  Our yards are placed so that within this range there is little else to forage on except the natural wild vegetation.  While this still is the case, as the forest has recovered there have been less open areas for the fields of wildflowers and good bee forage has been reduced.  An aerial view of our area and the location of some of our yards is in our picture gallery: <a href="aerial_view.php">AERIAL VIEW</a>. In addition to our home yards we have hives placed in the Wasilla area and other areas of Big Lake to add variety to the pollen and honey that we collect. Our locations are selected to avoid areas where industry, heavy agriculture and extensive road traffic are of concern.  We believe that whatever toxins are applied to plants or settle in the roadside ditches and vegetation have the potential to be taken up by plant roots and may very well show up in the honey that local hives produce. We avoid these areas to ensure that the quality of our honey stays the best that you can find anywhere.
                        </p>
                        <p>We also have a dealership in beekeeping supplies through Mann Lake Ltd. and carry supplies for the local beekeepers.  Although we are able to offer all of the items that are listed in the <a href="http://www.mannlakeltd.com/">MANN LAKE CATALOG</a> we don't have all the items in stock.  We have increased inventory each year and have a wide variety of beekeeping supplies on hand all year.  By bringing supplies to Alaska on pallets we can save on the cost of shipping, so our prices are likely to be less you can find elsewhere.  A list of <a href="order_supplies.php">SUPPLIES</a> is located on this site that we have on hand most all the time.
                        </p>
                        <p>We are also the largest supplier of package bees in the entire state.  We believe that the quality of our bees, queens and the service that we provide is the reason that we continue to grow. In the spring, we import packages of bees from Northern California to stock our hives.  We also import many additional packages for the local beekeepers association SABA (South-central Alaska Beekeepers Association) as well as other beekeepers in the area.  Packages are delivered in mid April to various areas of the region.  We guarantee our packages and queens to arrive in good shape with well mated queens ready to lay. If you are interested in ordering bees, please visit the <a href="stevesbees_home.php">PACKAGE BEES</a> page.  Orders for spring delivery need to be placed by the end of February (earlier if possible) to ensure availability.
                        </p>
                        <p>South-central Alaska Beekeepers Association is a group of beekeepers that get together each month in Eagle River just outside Anchorage.  Our membership is about 150 members.  It is a great group of people who share an enthusiasm for beekeeping.  They now have a website of their own, <a href="http://www.sababeekeepers.com/">www.sababeekeepers.com</a>.

                        <h3>CLASSES</h3>
                        <p>Beekeeping classes are taught in the spring of each year.  Our comprehensive class will provide you with more than enough information to make you feel comfortable working with the bees to gather a seasonable crop.  Classes begin in the early spring (late February or March) and provide enough time to order bees and build or purchase all equipment that you will need to be successful.  Call us for more details.
                        </p>
                        <p>When we started our business, our primary focus was on obtaining an abundant supply of  the highest quality honey that we could gather from the homestead.  As the land has slowly recovered from the fire that swept through our area, our focus has gradually shifted from producing honey as our main product to diversifying into the sale of equipment and bees to other beekeepers.  Over the years we have steadily reduced the number of hives that we run during the busy summer. Virginia's battle with cancer helped us to focus on the importance of spending time with our growing children.  The reduction of the number of hives has allowed us to take advantage of the summertime for family activities.  We still produce a fair bit of honey and strive to have a supply available throughout the year.  We have reduced our outlets to All About Herbs on the Palmer Wasilla Highway.  Of course we still sell direct from our house in Big Lake.
