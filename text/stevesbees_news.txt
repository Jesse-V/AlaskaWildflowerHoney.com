**Package bee update - supplies are still plentiful**

I have talked to our supplier and queen breeder yesterday (3-10-15) and he assured me that we should have an ample supply of packages throughout the month of March.

Bee orders are well underway now. We are now about 2 brood cycles from when our packages are to be filled. The weather systems in Northern California continue to be dry and temperatures in the Capay Valley where John has his breeding yards are in the 70s and 80s. John will start grafting our queens soon and we will be closely watching the temperatures for drone production and good mating flight weather. This will be the final determining factor in the arrival dates for our packages. Our packages are timed to take advantage of the turn of March weather in California for good mating flights as well as the willow bloom here in the Alaska spring. Better than 90% of the time the timing works out right.

This turn of the weather that we have had here in Alaska can be pretty tough on the bees that are over wintering. Large temperature swings are particularly tough on the colonies. As many of you know March is the toughest month to get the bees through. Weather is likely to get warm again this next week and it would be good to check to see how they are doing by the knock on the door and listening for the response from within.

Our delivery schedule remains unchanged from last posting:

We will be transporting bees to the interior only on the 18th of April so if you live in the interior and want your bees on a different day you will need to choose a different location for their arrival and make a note in the "special notes" box. You will not be charged transportation fees but will have to arrange transport or pick them up personally. This also applies to the Peninsula beekeepers.

For Anchorage and the Valley beekeepers, our scheduled pickup locations are arranged for the 11th and the 25th of April. Please choose the day that you prefer your bees to arrive after you select your pickup point. We have no scheduled location for Anchorage and Valley beekeepers to pick up on the 18th. In certain circumstances it is possible to have Anchorage and Valley bees arrive on this date. Please call me if you need to have this done.

The quantity of bee packages is still abundant and should remain plentiful for the next several weeks. I arrange our package shipment numbers in October with our supplier to ensure that we have the packages we need for the following spring.

As many of you know, I have made a couple of trips to the states this year and brought up more supplies in my cargo trailer. This year we have added Beemax Hives to the inventory here in Big Lake. We are pretty much fully stocked with hives and beekeeping equipment for the upcoming season. Please check our supplies store for inventory and prices.

**Package Bee Update - Time to Order**

Bee orders are well underway now and the hives are being placed into the almond orchards at this point in time. As many of you know, the increase in available pollen results in good population growth which means extra bees are ready to fill our packages. We are now about 3 brood cycles from when our packages are to be filled. It is at this point that we start paying closer attention to the weather systems in Northern California. In about a month John will start grafting our queens and we will be closely watching the temperatures for drone production and good mating flight weather. This will be the final determining factor in the arrival dates for our packages. Our packages are timed to take advantage of the turn of March weather in California for good mating flights as well as the willow bloom here in the Alaska spring. Better than 90% of the time the timing works out right.

Predicting when spring arrives at your house is something that I cannot do and beekeepers across the state have differing opinions on ideal hiving times. We have 3 dates of arrival for the bees and you are welcome to pick any of those dates. Having said that, you should be aware that for efficiency sake we have set up a delivery schedule for various geographical regions.

The quantity of bee packages is still abundant and should remain plentiful for the next several weeks. In past years we have sold out of our supply so please get your order in as soon as you know how many you want to order. Typically I arrange to have our supplier reserve a set number of packages to be ready to ship on each day and when those numbers are reached it is very difficult to obtain more bees. Competition for packages in California is intense each spring with more buyers than sellers. I arrange our package shipment numbers in October with our supplier to ensure that we have the packages we need for the following spring.

Beekeeping classes are scheduled for the 7th and 14th of March for those who are interested in a comprehensive beginning beekeeping course. This two part class will be on Saturday afternoons from noon to about 5:30.

Advanced beekeeping class is scheduled for the 28th of February and will be a one day course focusing on increasing hive yields, efficiency of time, as well as harvest and processing.

Both classes are being held in Eagle River at the VFW hall and sponsored by SABA beekeepers club.
