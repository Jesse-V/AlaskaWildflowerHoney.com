  ## Hive Checks

  One thing most all beekeepers do is hive checks. We check for this and we check for that and sometimes we just check. II am an advocate for regular hive checks and do mine every 10 days. Sometimes I check more often than that and it totally depends on the purpose of the hive check. Most of my hive checks are for swarm prevention and I know that it is very unlikely that a queen cell can rslip by in the 10 day period between checks. 10 days is a schedule that is tough to keep track of because whoever set up the calendar did the days in groups of seven so the day of the week is always different. I find that I sometimes have to write on the calendar when I checked a particular yard. I can pretty much spend the greater part of the day in the bee yard during the hive check day so I know the whole yard was done on a certain day.

  I was asked why I don't check on a particular day of the week so that it is easier to remember where I need to be. It is a very logical question and is a very sensible practice to do the weekly hive check. There is the predictability of the timing, as well as a couple of extra days built into the schedule in case something else comes up that needs doing instead. In fact weekly hive checks are an excellent practice to understand what is going on inside the hive. For the beekeeper that has only a few hives it is a wonderful way to pass a Saturday afternoon.

  I think that the reason that I adopted the 10-day schedule is that once a month I get a day off from checking hives. A 7-day schedule requires four checks during a month whereas a 10-day schedule means only 3. Keep in mind that the 10-day cycle is only good for swarm cells and supercedeure problems. During most of the season I check on the same schedule as most other beekeepers.

  When you hive a package you have to check in a day or two if the queen is released and then you have to check a week later to see if there are eggs. To loose the extra days without a queen laying eggs is a big mistake so more often is better here. During the setup of a new colony extra attention should be paid to the hive to correct anything that may be amiss. Such problems of pollen or nectar shortage, poor brood pattern, nectar bound brood nest and wazzling need to be spotted as soon as possible.

  ## Hiving Bees from Packages

  For a lot of beekeepers this information may be pretty basic but I hope that there is something in here that might increase the survival rate of the new bees for even the old timers. One of the important things to remember is that every bee that goes into the colony increases your honey crop. Bees that are left in the package often do not make it into the hive even if they are only a few inches from the entrance. If a bee is colder than about 45 degrees it is very difficult for them to move. Our hiving temperatures are frequently near this temperature or even colder.

  Package bees are under a higher level of stress and as beekeepers we need to do as much as possible to help them establish a new colony. The new home needs to be as clean, dry, and as draft free as possible. A few frames of drawn comb are very useful if the hive is new and the bees are starting on foundation. They also need a food source right away so that energy replacement is easy to obtain. Giving your bees a spray of sugar water prior to hiving helps out with the dehydration as well as the energy levels.

  If the packages are not to be installed right away they should be kept in a cool dark place and occasionally sprayed with sugar water. Make sure that the bees have lots of air circulation and are away from potential air pollutants of chemicals and exhaust. A practical limit of about 5 days is about as long as you can expect to hold them prior to installation.

  Spray the package lightly with sugar water again prior to installation to keep the bees from flying too much and to give them some of the energy that they will need as they get to know their new home.

  When you get ready to shake the bees out of the package you might want to have an extra super on hand (an empty one) to act as a guide for the bees to land on the topbars of the hive. Place the empty super on top of the hive after removing several frames to make room for the bees. This will make a short wall around the top of the hive and prevent bees from ending up over the edge and down on the ground. Speaking of things down on the ground, don't forget to wear some tall boots or take measures to prevent bees from getting lost up inside your pant legs. A simple wrap with tape will help a lot.

  Keep the queen protected from the elements during the hiving process and remember that it takes a few days for the bees to get used to their new queen. I have always figured at least 3 days together is a good rule of thumb to go by. I always start counting from the time that the package was put together so if the bees traveled several days in the package or they are not hived right away you might not have to wait as long. Letting her hang in the cage inside the super is a good idea. Make sure that the other bees can feed her and place the cage so that the feeder jar does not drip on the queen. Release the queen into a calm hive in a few days. Often you can see if the bees are attacking the queen through the cage wire instead of feeding her, this would be a sign to wait for an extra day or two.

  Once the bees have been hived feed them continuously with supplemental sugar syrup and provide pollen substitute unless a pollen bloom is well underway.

  ## Pollen Trapping

  Keeping an eye on the pollen might help let us know what plants our bees are visiting. Some plants are good pollen producers and some don't give the bees much at all. Depending on the needs of the hive the bees may spend a fair bit of time gathering pollen instead of nectar. Very often the pollen and nectar gathering go hand in hand as both are necessary to the health of the hive. Spring is a really good time of year to trap some of the pollen that the bees are hauling in. The trapped pollen can be used to feed back to the bees in time of pollen deficiencies, eaten by the family or sold on the health market.

  There is a fair bit of evidence supporting the healthful benefits of eating local pollen. Ideally the best market for selling pollen to people with sensitivities to the natural air born pollen is to sell them pollen before the plants bloom and put the stuff in the air. To do this a beekeeper must trap pollen, date it and then freeze it for sale the following year. Vacuum packing will give the best chance of preserving the quality of your product. Watch the spring growth and bring your pollen on the market a few weeks prior to the actual pollen bloom. Here are a few pollen types that show up in the hive.

  ## Finding the Queen

  The following information comes to us from Weaver apiaries. I have modified it somewhat to make it more applicable to our season and have inserted some tips that I have picked up on in the last few years from other members of the group. Their writing is iI have put those remarks in Italics to let folks know as best as I can whose words are whose.

  Weaver says:

  > Use a bee smoker, but use a minimum amount of smoke. It is best to puff a little into the entrance, and then waft a little over the tops of the frames while your are removing the cover. If the bees are in two stories, give them a little smoke between hive bodies as you remove the top story. As you break them apart bend over and look to see if the old queen is on the top bars of the frames in the bottom story as she moves from the upper story to the bottom. Then set the upper story catty-cornered on the upside down cover which you have placed on the ground just behind the beehive. Then decide which hive body the queen is most likely to be laying in, and examine the combs in it first.

  In the case of this present season I don't know of anyone that has added the second super to the brood nest yet. When we have a small population of bees as we now do we have a pretty good idea where she ought to be. Her job is to lay eggs in the brood nest and that means that she is most likely in the center 5 frames of the box. I did a hive check last week and of the 100 queens there was only one on the outside frame and there were only 3 on the second frame.

  > Beginners tend to see all of the thousands of bees in the hive. You are looking for the one that looks different, so try not to see any individual bees, but concentrate on trying to see the one that looks like a queen. Try to look quickly.

  Looking quickly and ignoring all the details seems to help me find her as well. Figure that your exam for the queen is similar to looking for a particular sentence or a word in paragraph. Skim first before reading in detail to find the your target. Check the following paragraph for the word **working** using a skim first method and you will see what I mean. Another thing that I look for is an area of decreased activity and bees that seem to be in a small cluster.

  > We like to kneel beside the hive and remove the third comb from the nearside. Look at the side toward you as you are pulling it out of the hive, then if you did not spot the queen quickly, flip it over and look on the other side. It is natural for queens to try to hide, so be sure to look in any cracks between the comb and frame. If you haven't found the queen, lean that comb against the hive body you are not working in, or against the far side of the hive you are in. Then remove the second comb from the near side, and repeat the process of examination, and lean it against the third comb that is already out. Next examine the wall comb, and look down at the wall of the hive. Sometimes the queen has run over to the wall and is running around on it. If no queen, put the wall comb back in place. Now remove the fourth comb, looking quickly at the near side of the fifth comb before you examine the fourth comb. Put the fourth comb back into the hive against the sidewall comb, so it now becomes the second comb. Repeat that process until you have gone all the way across the hive and have examined the far sidewall. Of course you should stop this process as soon as you have found the queen. Put the far sidewall comb back into place and put the two other combs that are standing out back so the brood nest is well organized.

  Keeping all the combs in the original order is a pretty good thing to do, particularly in cooler weather to keep the nest from being split.

  > If robbing has not started, you may now look for the queen in the other hive body. If there is brood in only two or three combs, it might be best to start with the comb that you think is the first one that will have brood.

  If you have been unable to find the queen on the first time through it may be best to go through the hive again. This time, be sure to check for eggs. If you see eggs it is very likely that she is still in there and has been laying up until less than 3 days ago. Last but not least before you button up the hive take a glance around on the ground to see if she fell off the comb during your hive exam. Any clump of bees on the ground has a potential queen in it. I find it helpful to examine the combs over the hive in case she falls off. But before you leave the area give that clump on the ground a stir with your hive tool and see if she is there.

  If you can't find any evidence of the queen then you might want to consider placing a new queen in the hive. Be sure that you let the bees get used to the new queen before you let her out of her cage. Hang her in the hive for 3 or 4 days for the bees to get used to her. Make sure that she can be fed through the screen of the cage by the other bees and that she is in a place that won't be directly under a feeder that might drip on her. Before you let her loose, check once again for eggs or queen cells. The bees are sensitive to disruption at this time so feed them and don't disturb the hive unnecessarily for several more days or they may kill the new queen. One thing that can disturb the hive is robbing from another colony so it might be wise to watch for signs of this and take preventative action. This might include something like an entrance reducer or simply placing a piece of duct tape over most of the entrance.
