### Classes

Beekeeping classes are taught in the spring of each year. Our comprehensive class will provide you with more than enough information to make you feel comfortable working with the bees to gather a seasonable crop. Classes begin in the early spring (late February or March) and provide enough time to order bees and build or purchase all equipment that you will need to be successful. Call us for more details.

When we started our business, our primary focus was on obtaining an abundant supply of the highest quality honey that we could gather from the homestead. As the land has slowly recovered from the fire that swept through our area, our focus has gradually shifted from producing honey as our main product to diversifying into the sale of equipment and bees to other beekeepers. Over the years we have steadily reduced the number of hives that we run during the busy summer. Virginia's battle with cancer helped us to focus on the importance of spending time with our growing children. The reduction of the number of hives has allowed us to take advantage of the summertime for family activities. We still produce a fair bit of honey and strive to have a supply available throughout the year. We have reduced our outlets to All About Herbs on the Palmer Wasilla Highway. Of course we still sell direct from our house in Big Lake.
